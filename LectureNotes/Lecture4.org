#+TITLE: Lecture 4: Object Relationships
* Objects
  - One class can have many instances (objects).
    - A simple but very important concept!
  - These objects can form complex structures among
    themselves. Consider this:
    #+BEGIN_SRC java
      public class Person
      {
          private Set<Person> friends;
          ...
      }
    #+END_SRC
  - The corresponding class diagram looks trivial: Person → Person
  - But the /object/ structures could be very complex.
    - Imagine 100 Person objects, each with 10 friends.
** UML Object Diagrams
   - We'll use /Object Diagrams/ to represent object structure.
     - Rather, /examples/ of object structure, since the actual
       objects are created at runtime.
   - Say a Department has several Employees.
   - We could have the following object structure:
     - Department
       - title = R&D
       - budget = 300,000
     - Employee
       - name = Ralph
       - dateOfBirth = 1990-01-10
       - id = 24680
       - salary = 60,000
     - Employee
       - name = Sam
       - dateOfBirth = 1992-05-17
       - id = 12345
       - salary = 50,000
     - Employee
       - name = Lauren
       - dateOfBirth = 1985-09-12
       - id = 36925
       - salary = 70,000
   - Each object is represented like this:
     - object name : class name
       - field1 = value1
       - field2 = value2
     - The object name is often not really needed.
   - Objects associate and/or aggregate with other objects.
     - But only one-to-one - no multiplicity.
     - There is only /one/ of each object.
   - Objects /do not/ inherit from other objects.
     #+BEGIN_SRC java
       public class Employee extends Person { ... }

       emp = new Employee(...);
     #+END_SRC
     - Inheritance occurs between classes, not objects.
     - Only /one object/ here (emp), with properties of both classes.
* Copying and Wrapping
** Recap: Aggregation vs Association
   - Aggregation
     - A "while-part" relationship between two objects.
     - One object owns the other.
     - The owning ("whole") object has a field referring to the "part"
       object.
     - =ClassA= ◇→ =ClassB=
   - Association (or "acquaintance"):
     - The two objects involved are equals. Neither one is the "whole"
       or "part".
     - As a result, associations can be circular (e.g. A refers to B,
       B refers to C, and C refers to A).
     - =ClassA= → =ClassB=
** Accessing an Object
   #+BEGIN_SRC java
     public class ShoppingCart
     {
         private ClassB field;
         ...
         public classB getField()
         {
             return field;              // This?
             return new ClassB(field);  // Or this?
         }
     }
   #+END_SRC
   - How should you implement the above accessor?
   - /Both/ approaches are valid in different situations.
   - Depends on strength of the relationship between ClassA and ClassB.
** Accessing an Object: Your Options
   - How should you give access to an object field?
     1. /Don't!/ (if you don't need to.)
     2. /Or/ return a *reference*:
        #+BEGIN_SRC java
          public Point getCentre() { return centrePoint; }
        #+END_SRC
     3. /Or/ return a *const reference* (C++ only):
        #+BEGIN_SRC C++
          const Point& Circle::getCentre() const {...}  // C++
        #+END_SRC
     4. /Or/ return a *copy*:
        #+BEGIN_SRC java
          public Point getCentre()
          {
              return centrePoint.clone();
          }
        #+END_SRC
     5. /Or/ return a *read-only wrapper*:
        #+BEGIN_SRC java
          public ReadOnlyPoint getCentre()
          {
              return new ReadOnlyPoint(centrePoint);
          }
        #+END_SRC
** How do you Copy and Object?
   - The copy constructor?
     #+BEGIN_SRC java
       TheClass copy = new TheClass(original);
     #+END_SRC
   - Problem: you must know the exact class.
     - What if the original is a /subtype/ of TheClass?
     - This kills inheritance (just like raw objects).
   - Solution: an overridable clone() method:
     #+BEGIN_SRC java
       TheClass copy = original.clone();
     #+END_SRC
     - This will handle subclasses.
     - Each subclass overrides clone() to return a copy of itself.
     - So, we can make a copy without knowing the exact class.
** How do you Wrap an Object?
   - Consider this:
     #+BEGIN_SRC java
       public class ReadOnlyPoint  // Wrapper class
       {
           private Point p;
           public ReadOnlyPoint(Point p) { this.p = p; }
           public int getX() { return p.getX(); }
           public int getY() { return p.getY(); }
       } // No mutators
     #+END_SRC
   - ReadOnlyPoint "wraps around" a Point.
   - You can access a Point, but not modify it.
     - Point may have setters, but there's no way to call them given a
       ReadOnlyPoint.
   - An alternative to making a copy of the Point. Why?
     - Copying can be slow, for objects that use lots of memory (not
       so much Point, but other cases).
** Wrapping Containers
   - In Java, you can get a read-only view of a list, set or map:
     #+BEGIN_SRC java
       List<Thing> listView =
           Collections.unmodifiableList(myList);
     #+END_SRC
     - (See the Collections class javadocs for more details.)
** When Not to Copy/Wrap Objects
   - Aggregation and association are not always so protected.
     - In Java, the LinkedList class does not copy/wrap objects for
       you.
     - In most languages, container structures don't copy things.
     - (C++ does, when you pass objects by value, it then doesn't have
       a choice.)
   - Often the aggregation/association is /supposed/ to be publicly
     accessible.
   - Associations would be impossible to set up if accessors always
     returned copies.
*** Don't Copy/Wrap Immutable Objects
    - Immutable objects pose no risk to encapsulation.
    - It is totally unnecessary to copy/wrap them.
*** That Said...
    - /Do copy/wrap/ an object when it's:
      - Mutable, /and/
      - Part of the internal workings of another class
    - Usually applies to generic classes storing dates, addresses,
      etc. (if mutable).
    - Usually applies to containers:
      #+BEGIN_SRC java
        public class ShoppingCart
        {
            private Set<Product> products;
            public Set<Product> getProducts()
            {
                return Collections.unmodifiableSet(products);
            }
        } // *Don't* return 'products' directly.
      #+END_SRC
    - The products set is part of the internal workings of
      ShoppingCart.
* Communication
** Object Communication
   - How do two objects communicate? Method calls.
     #+BEGIN_SRC java
       public class ClassA
       {
           private ClassB field;

           public void methodOne()
           {
               int argument, value;
               ...
               value = field.methodTwo(argument);
               ...
           }
       } // Spot the *two* communicating objects!
     #+END_SRC
** Intermediate Objects
   - Say object 1 wants to communicate with object 2.
   - Say they must exchange complex information.
   - You might do this using object 3. e.g.
     #+BEGIN_SRC java
       s = new Search();
       s.setSearchName("Bob");
       s.setSearchEmail("@gmail.com");
       s.setCaseSensitivity(false);
       s.setPartialMatch(true);

       entry = addressBook.search(s);
     #+END_SRC
     - AddressBok can search by name, email, other fields, or a
       /combination/ thereof. It can be case sensitive (or not), and
       partial (or complete).
     - Just one search() method will do - not hundreds.
     - We can pass complex information using a Search object.
** Traversal of Objects
   - Given objA, how do you obtain the value
   - Beyond the choice of path, there are two ideas:
     1. Retrieve a reference to each intermediate object, using it to
        get to the next one. e.g.
        #+BEGIN_SRC java
          value = objA.getB().getD().getF().getValue();
        #+END_SRC
     2. Have the intermediate objects find the value themselves:
        #+BEGIN_SRC java
          value = objA.getValue();
        #+END_SRC
        (With similar code appearing inside classA - ClassE.)
** Law (or Suggestion) of Demeter
   - The "Law of Demeter" (LoD) is more advice than law.
     - Named for the "Demeter Project".
   - LoD says that objects should only communicate if they are
     directly aggregated/associated.
     - Avoid chains of accessor calls (as in previous section).
     - Avoids coupling between distant classes.
   - However, there is a tradeoff:
     - Intermediate classes can become very cluttered.
     - They can have many methods that simply delegate to another
       object.
   - Always consider the LoD, but don't follow it blindly.
* Decorator Pattern
  - Use recursive aggregation.
  - Create a linked list of objects
    - /Not/ for storing a sequence of data.
    - For providing a set of add-on functionality.
  - Used to avoid an unmanageable explosion of subclasses.
    - What if there are many /independent/ ways to extend a class?
    - You'd need a subclass for every possible combination!
    - Or you could have one /decoration/ class for each individual
      feature.
** Rationale
   - Say you're writing a role-playing computer game.
   - The player starts with a character from one of 10 "races":
     - Each race interacts with the game differently.
     - You write a GameCharacter class, and a subclass for each race.
   - As the game progresses, the player's character can acquire other
     special abilities and characteristics.
     - Stealth, healing powers, temporary invincibility,
       super-strength, etc.
   - How would you implement these? Two naive options:
     - You could put all this extra functionality in the GameCharacter
       superclass.
     - You could have extra subclasses.
   - What's wrong with everything-in-the-superclass?
     - You end up with huge a class, with many separate
       responsibilities.
     - Difficult to maintain.
   - What's wrong with extra subclasses?
     - Consider the special abilities again: stealth, healing powers,
       temporary invincibility, super-strength, etc.
     - A character could acquire several of these abilities at once.
     - 10 races and 4 independent special abilities requires 160 (10 ×
       2⁴) subclasses. That doubles for each additional ability.
     - Those classes are highly redundant
   - What's the alternative?
     - Have 14 subclasses of GameCharacter.
     - 10 for the races, and 4 for the special abilities.
     - The race classes will be self-sufficient.
     - The ability classes will be add-ons that wrap around an
       existing GameCharacter object.
** Object Structure
   :Context → :Decoration → :Decoration → :Decoration →
   :Implementation
   - The Decoration objects form a linked list.
   - At the end, there is an object with a basic level of functionality
   - Each decoration object:
     - "Impersonates" the end object, by implementing the same
       interface.
     - Passes on method calls to the next object.
     - Makes certain tweaks with these method calls happen.
** Game Example
   :GameEngine → :Stealth → :SuperStrength → :ElfCharacter[health =
   75] 
   
   :GameEngind → :Healing → :HumanCharacter[health = 60]
   - In our game, we'll have several implementation classes:
     ~HumanCharacter, ElfCharacter, etc~
   - They'll have these methods:
     - attack() returns the strength (int) of a character's attack.
     - defend() takes an int and reduces the character's health.
     - setHealth() and getHealth().
   - Stealth, SuperStrength and Healing have them too:
     - SuperStrength.attack() returns "next.attack() * 2"
       - (Doubles the damage dealt to another character.)
     - Stealth.defend(x) calls "next.defend(x / 2)".
       - (Halves the damage received by this character)
     - Healing.attack(x) doesn't alter the attack, but increases
       /this/ character's health at the same time.
     - Here's the common interface for both base implementations /and
       decorators/.
     - (The Decorator Pattern only works because we can pretend that a
       decoration /is/ a GameCharacter, in this case.)
       #+BEGIN_SRC java
         public interface GameCharacter
         {
             int attack();
             void defend(int damage);
             void setHealth(int health);
             int getHealth();
         }

         public class ElfCharacter implements GameCharacter
         {
             private int health = 100;
             public ElfCharacter() {}

             @Override public int attack() { return 10; }
             @Override public void defend(int damage)
             {
                 health -= damage;
                 if(health <= 0) {...}
             }
    
             @Override public void setHealth(int health) {...}
             @Override public int getHealth() {...}
         }
       #+END_SRC
     - Each base implementation would do this a bit differently.
     - We could also have a common superclass /just/ for the base
       implementations.
       #+BEGIN_SRC java
         public abstract class Ability implements GameCharacter
         {    // Decoration superclass
             protected GameCharacter next;
             public Ability(GameCharacter next) { this.next = next; }

             @Override public int attack() { return next.attack(); }

             @Override public void defend(int damage)
             {
                 next.defend(damage);
             }
             @Override public void setHealth(int health)
             {
                 next.setHealth(health);
             }
             @Override public int getHealth()
             {
                 return next.getHealth();
             }
         }   // Every method here just passes on to "next".
       #+END_SRC
     - The decoration superclass delegates everything.
     - The decoration /subclasses/ can then re-override certain
       methods and change the behaviour.
       #+BEGIN_SRC java
         public class Stealth extends Ability
         {
             public Stealth(GameCharacter next)
             {
                 super(next);
             }

             @Override
             public void defend(int damage)  // When defending, reduce damage by half
             {
                 next.defend(damage / 2);
             }
         }
       #+END_SRC
** Java IO
   - Java's IO streams are based on the decorator pattern.
   - :Context → :BufferdInputStream → :CheckedInputStream →
     :FileInputStream
   - Here, an instance of FileInputStream is the data source.
   - The other objects are /decorating/ it, adding functionality.
   - Each of their classes implement the InputStream interface.
   - So, they can all be mixed and matched:
     - FileInputStream could be replaced with ByteArrayInputStream.
     - The others could be replaced, or re-ordered, or added to.
* Composite Pattern
