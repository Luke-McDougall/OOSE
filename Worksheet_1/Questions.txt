1. Discussion: Multiplicity
a) No, those methods would make more sense for the City class. 

b) A getTotalPopulation() method that returns the sum of the populations of each city.
   A getCity(String name) method, an addCity(City new_city) method.

c) getTotalPopulation() and getCity() would be the same because you have to iterate over
   the collection to sum the populations or check the passed string against the name of each
   city respectively. addCity() would be different with a set because with a list you'd have
   to iterate over all the elements to make sure you aren't adding a city that is already there
   but set can't have duplicate elements so you'd just add the city to the set and if it works
   the new city isn't a duplicate.

2. Discussion: Maps and Multiplicity
a) getProperty(Address addr), getAddress(Property property), 
   addProperty(Address addr, Property property), removeProperty(Address addr)

b) Because the address is used as the key in the map you would have to remove the entry in the
   map with that address and add it again with the updated address.
